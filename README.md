An implementation of VisualBackProp using the Keras framework.

This implementation is hardcoded and handles only the VGG19 architecture

This implementation is based on [VisualBackProp: efficient visualization of CNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.05418v3) and [Visualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.2901v3)

This will probably be turned into a proper tool in the future using [transparent-keras](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transparent-keras)
